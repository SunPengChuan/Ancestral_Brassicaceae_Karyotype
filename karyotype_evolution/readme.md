## Karyotype evolution

Each folder named after a species contains four types of files: *.png, *.csv, *.ancestor.txt, and *.svg.

The *.png and *.csv files represent the comparison of the current species' chromosomes with their direct orthologous chromosomes from ACBK and the extracted collinear gene sets, respectively.

The *.ancestor.txt and *.svg files depict the mapping relationship between the current species and the ancestral karyotypes at different nodes, as well as the corresponding order diagrams, respectively.
